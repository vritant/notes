## Demand Theory
* Market demand function is usually like Q = Pb1 + Ib2 + Sb3 + Ab4
  * Quantity = f(Price, income, cost of production, advertising)
* We write, P = a-bQ
  * Other factors remaining constant
* Eta = Own price elasticity of demand
  * Eta = (P/Q)(dQ/dP)
 Â * dQ/dP is inverse of slope
